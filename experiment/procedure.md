Procedure:
1.	Start the smoke generator and connect it to smoke injector.
2.	Mount a model (cylinder or airfoil) in the wind tunnel test section.
3.	Start the wind tunnel and setup a velocity.
4.	Observe and record the flow structures.
5.	Observe the different flow structures:
    - Difference between the flow structure of different size of cylinder
    - Change in flow structure with increase in angle of attack of airfoil
